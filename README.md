# TEXTOOL

This tool was created as a learning project for regex and CLI implementation with typer. But it grew to be a somewhat useful tool for identifying personal identifiable information (PII) for Croatia.

So far it can identify:
- OIB (Osobni Identifikacijski Broj, Perosnal Identification Number)
- JMBG (Jedinstveni Matični Broj Građana - Unique Master Citizen Number)
- MBO (Matični Broj Osiguranika - Insured Person Number)

This is version 0.0.1, more features to follow.
